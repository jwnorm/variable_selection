# Variable Selection

> **Note:** This repo is related to my fourth homework assignment for ISE537 at NC State University.

## Overview

This is project is based on the QSAR Bioconcentration data set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/510/qsar+bioconcentration+classes+dataset). The Quarto Document walks through a variable selection analysis through a variety of techniques. There is also a section on regularization and prediction.
